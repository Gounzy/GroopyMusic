Doté d’expérience en événementiel et actif au sein d’une agence digitale depuis plus de 3 ans, Alexis entend mettre à disposition son expérience en communication digitale et en coordination de projets pour soutenir la croissance de l’ASBL. Le projet constitue en effet à ses yeux un véritable potentiel pour réunir deux ses aspirations : la musique et l’entreprenariat, au sein d’une équipe motivée et multidisciplinaire."
